### Project Breakdown: Building a Solar System Explorer with Vite, React, and Three.js

#### Part 1: Setting Up the HomePage

**Objective:** Create the homepage with the solar system scene using React and Three.js.

---

### Homework Instructions

1. **Initialize the Project:**
   - Create a new Vite project with the React template.
   - Install necessary dependencies (`react-router-dom` for routing and `three` for 3D rendering).

   **Documentation:**
   - [Vite - Getting Started](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
   - [React Router - Quick Start](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview)
   - [Three.js - Getting Started](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene)

2. **Set Up the Project Structure:**
   - In the `src` folder, create the following subdirectories: `pages`, `components`.
   - Under `pages`, create a `HomePage` folder.
   - Inside `HomePage`, create a `components` folder to store all the components required to build the solar system.

3. **Configure React Router:**
   - Set up the main application to use React Router.
   - Create a route for the homepage.

4. **Build the HomePage Layout:**
   - Create an `index.jsx` file in the `HomePage` folder.
   - Define the basic structure of the homepage.

5. **Create the Solar System Components:**
   - In the `components` folder inside `HomePage`, create the following components:
     - **Sun**: Represents the sun.
     - **Planet**: Represents individual planets (you can create a base Planet component and extend it for each planet).
     - **Orbit**: Represents the orbits of the planets around the sun.
   - Each component should be responsible for rendering and positioning its respective part of the solar system.

   **Documentation:**
   - [Three.js - Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Object3D)
   - [Three.js - Geometries](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/Geometry)

6. **Set Up Three.js in React:**
   - Initialize a Three.js scene within the HomePage component.
   - Add the camera and renderer to the scene.
   - Ensure that the renderer outputs to the React component.

   **Documentation:**
   - [Three.js - Cameras](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/Camera)
   - [Three.js - Renderers](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer)

7. **Animate the Solar System:**
   - Create an animation loop to rotate the planets around the sun.
   - Use Three.js methods to update the positions of the planets and orbits.

   **Documentation:**
   - [Three.js - Animation Loop](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Animation-system)

8. **Interactive Features:**
   - Make the sun and planets clickable.
   - On click, fetch and display more detailed information about the celestial body.

   **Documentation:**
   - [React - Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

### Summary of Tasks:

1. Initialize Vite project.
